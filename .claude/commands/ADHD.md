# ADHD — Living Project Brain Dump

> **Trigger:** Type `ADHD` or `/ADHD` anywhere in Claude Code  
> **Effect:** Generates or updates `~/ADHD.md` in the current project directory (or `~` if no project)

---

## What You Do

When the user says `ADHD` (or runs `/ADHD`), you **generate or update** a file called `ADHD.md`.

- If `ADHD.md` **doesn't exist** → create it fresh from scratch
- If `ADHD.md` **already exists** → read it first, then update/merge — preserve good sections, improve outdated ones

The file lives at the **root of the current project** (or `~/ADHD.md` if not inside a project).

---

## The File You Produce

Write `ADHD.md` using this exact structure. Keep it **short, visual, scannable**. One-liners > paragraphs. Emojis as anchors. No walls of text.

```markdown
# ⚡ [PROJECT NAME] — ADHD.md
> *Last updated: [DATE]*

## Rules

- **Tone:** Casual, direct, Nick-style. No corporate fluff.
- **Length:** Short. If a section has nothing yet → write `_TBD_` or skip it.
- **Context:** Pull everything from the current conversation + any open files. Don't ask — just write.
- **Arguments:** If Nick passes text after `ADHD` (e.g. `ADHD added R2 upload flow`), treat it as a changelog note and prepend it to `Nick's Notes` with the date.
- **Confirm:** After writing, reply with: `✅ ADHD.md updated — [path]`

## Example Trigger Phrases That Count

- `ADHD`
- `/ADHD`
- `ADHD we just added the photo gen flow`
- `ADHD update`
